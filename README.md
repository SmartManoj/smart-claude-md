# smart-claude-md

Plain-English, **universal** rules for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) — the ones the popular CLAUDE.md repos don't quite give you.

## Why this exists

Most shared CLAUDE.md rule sets fall into one of two gaps:

- **Personalized, not portable** — e.g. the widely-shared "Working with Q" protocol phrases rules as *"when Q asks a question…"*, where `Q` is the author's personal handle. You can't copy it verbatim.
- **Dense, not plain** — other template repos are written in jargon-heavy prose that's hard to read and adapt.

This repo keeps every rule **one sentence, plain English, phrased as "the user," and portable to any project.**

## The rules

See [`SMART-CLAUDE.md`](./SMART-CLAUDE.md).

## Usage

Append a rule to your global config (applies to every project):

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md      # macOS / Linux
%USERPROFILE%\.claude\CLAUDE.md   # Windows
```

…or to a project-level `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root.

## Sync

Rather than copy-pasting, keep the rules as this separate repo and **import** them
into your global config. `sync.py` does this for you — it `git pull`s the latest
rules and adds a native `@import` line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (idempotent):

```bash
python sync.py
```

It appends a single import line to your global CLAUDE.md:

```
@/path/to/smart-claude-md/SMART-CLAUDE.md
```

### Daily auto-sync

Run `sync.py` once a day so rule updates land automatically.

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**

```powershell
schtasks /Create /TN "smart-claude-md-sync" /SC DAILY /ST 09:00 /F ^
  /TR "python \"%USERPROFILE%\smart-claude-md\sync.py\""
```

**macOS / Linux (cron — `crontab -e`):**

```
0 9 * * * cd ~/smart-claude-md && python3 sync.py
```

## Background

The "answer the question before acting" behavior is a recognized one. In
[anthropics/claude-code#742](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/742)
("Claude Doesn't Follow Instructions"), Anthropic noted model-level improvements
are "expected over time" and recommended **explicit prompting** as the practical
mitigation — which is exactly what these rules are.
